=========
_Version 4.08 BETA - Only to be used in presence of developers._



OpenNX Server (a.k.a. Nebula) is media asset management and workflow automation system for TV and radio broadcast. 
Nebula profits from several great open source projects such as [ffmpeg](http://www.ffmpeg.org) and [CasparCG](http://www.casparcg.com) 
and provides (almost) complete toolset for:

 - signal, stream and file based ingest
 - media asset management, metadata handling
 - conversion, video and audio normalization (incl. EBU R128)
 - programme planning, scheduling
 - playout control
 - dynamic CG
 - web publishing
 - statistics

This GPL version replaces our software which existed for more than 5 years and has been used in several TV stations in Czech republic.
It has been completely redesigned and rewritten from scratch.
