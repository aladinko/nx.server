## About

OpenNX Server (a.k.a Nebula) is media asset management and workflow automation system for TV and radio broadcast. 
Nebula profits from several great open source projects such as ffmpeg and CasparCG and provides (almost) complete toolset for:

 - signal, stream and file based ingest
 - media asset management, metadata handling
 - conversion, video and audio normalization (incl. EBU R128)
 - programme planning, scheduling
 - playout control
 - dynamic CG
 - web publishing
 - statistics

This GPL version replaces our software which existed for more than 5 years and has been used in several Czech TV stations.
It has been completely redesigned and rewritten from scratch.
